				<h2 class="sec-title">Approach</h2>
				<p>The project followed the double diamond model. Emphasis was placed on the research and discovery phase, to emphasise the needs of the user. We made sure to use research processes that delivered real insights <em>(card sorting, interviews, observation)</em>.</p>

				<h2 class="sec-title">Process</h2>
				<p>As this was a project with a quick turnaround. We ran a week long design sprint to iterate the app in collaboration with users. This was an excellent experience to work in a fast paced design environment.</p>

				<h2 class="sec-title">Goals</h2>
				<p>The main goal of the project was to improve the lives of people who are caring for multiple pets. As pets are considered to be "part of the family", one of the biggest challenges was conducting research respectfully. The data gathered related to personal lifestyle choices of the owners regarding their pets. Whilst being respectful and open, we also had to gather enough detail to produce a purposeful design solution.</p>
				<p>To ensure that all the information was thoroughly reviewed personas, experience maps and storyboards were used. This helped to ensure that the most meaningful insights, with the greatest value to users could be collated.</p>

				<p>Prototypes were extensively tested with defined target users. Users were encouraged to interact with the prototype app, this helped to ascertain if it was intuitive to use.</p>

				<h2 class="sec-title">Outcome</h2>
				<p>The main goal of the project was to improve the lives of people who are caring for multiple pets. Our team achieved this by producing an app that linked key care components for each pet onto one system. Owners could easily access pet services such as veterinarians and petsitters, set tasks and routines for their pets; and while away, delegate those tasks to relevant carers remotely to monitor progress.  </p>
