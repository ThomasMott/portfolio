				<h2 class="sec-title">Approach</h2>
				<p>The project followed the double diamond with empahsis being placed on the needs of the user. We made sure to use research processes that delivered real insights <em>(card sorting, interviews, observation)</em>.</p>
				<img class="case-img" src="../static/images/pl/pl-e.png" alt="brainstorming on whiteboards">
				<p>As this was a project with a quick turnaround. We ran a week long design sprint to iterate quickly and learn from users. This was an excellent experience to work in a fast paced design environment.</p>
				<img class="case-img" src="../static/images/pl/pl-j.png" alt="design sprint process">
				<h2 class="sec-title">Goals</h2>
				<p>The main goal of the project was to improve the lives of people who are used to dealing with multiple pets. As pets are extremely personal and important, one of the biggest challenges was conducting research respectfully whilst gathering enough detail to produce a meaningful design solution.</p>
				<p>To ensure that all the information was thoroughly reviewed personas, experience maps and storyboards were used. This helped to ensure that the most meaningful insights, with the greatest value to users could be concluded.</p>
				<img class="case-img" src="../static/images/pl/pl-em.png" alt="experience map" style="height: auto;">
				<p>Protoypes were extensivley tested with defined target users.They were encouraged to interact with the prototypes so we could ensure it was intuitive.</p>
