				<h2 class="sec-title">Approach</h2>
				<p>The design process followed the double diamond, the biggest focus for this project was providing value to users as well as making sure that the final output was feasable for developers. This required a lot of multidisciplinary team working.</p>
				<img class="case-img" src="../static/images/rc/rc-3.jpg" alt="brainstorming AI flow">
				<p>Initial wire-frame were sketched out so I had an idea of how the app would flow. These were tested with body-storming.This was then transferred into Adobe XD to create something more interactive and tangible.</p>
				<p>To make sure the prototype was suited to my research participant I sat down an observed them, noting down key information.</p>
				<img class="case-img" src="../static/images/rc/rc-2.jpg" alt="user testing">
				<h2 class="sec-title">Goals</h2>
				<p>The main goal of the project was to improve the university experience for those who were not feeling supported. The greatest challenge of the project was enabling the individual without having a negative impact on the existing services. Making sure the AI was relevant and that data was handled ethically were also primary concerns.</p>
				<h2 class="sec-title">Outcome</h2>
				<p>User testing showed that there was a lot of benefit to the project.</p>
